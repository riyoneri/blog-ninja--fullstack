# Blog Ninja

Blog Ninja is a full-stack web application for managing blog posts. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. `back-end`: This is the server-side of the application, written in Express.js.
2. `front-end`: This is the client-side of the application, written in Next.js.

Each of these directories has its own README file with more specific information.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies in both the `back-end` and `front-end` directories.
